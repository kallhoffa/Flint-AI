Weaken the impact of new connections without destroying the ability of a desperate system
- increase hebian for successful ops
-decrease the initial strengthen during successful ops
this means random fires will be not be as rewardered like the rest

NOT THE ISSUE
the issue is that the pathways are conflicting, and one disrailmemnt is destroying the refinement of the other

THE NUMBER FOR NEW CONNECTIONS MUST BE LESS THAN MAX CONNECTION - HEBBIAN IS THE SAME WAY

Hebbian limit higher than normal is greater
new problem - as long as two target one, it will keep firing, but not be of any use. Gotta be a way to stop from triggering neuron thats not doing any favors



The current setup (rewarding after completetion and weight update when firing) can get perfect with set starting conditions

Ideas to implement post firing growth:
-list of neurons that have fired recently. 
-if no action, they decline as normal. 
-if dopamine, everyone on the list gets rewarded, the list is flushed
-if punish, everyone is disuaded, the list is flushed
-temporal based rewards, so new guys get bigger rewards

when fired, add to list done but adds twice
if oldest in list is greater than age max, chop it
if dopamine increases, reward everyone on the list. 

dont add to list twice


fire- weaken connection (hebbian negates if next fires)
add to lists

if reward happens, update all weights, empty list


inhibiting chance kills the network!!! gotta restart the current no inhib

d is not recorded in txt file

doesnt know what getting closer is. doesnt reward small victories

gets stuck on new spots

work of new inputs overrights work of old ones
-implent a change where random connections are more contained

the best learning time is 1. but it limits its upper limits
